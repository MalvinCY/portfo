                  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                  <p>I'm Malvin — a Clinical Data Analyst with 8+ years of experience spanning clinical trials, biotech manufacturing, and data analytics. I hold an M.Sc. in Clinical Drug Development (Distinction) from UCL and a B.Sc. in Pharmacology &amp; Molecular Genetics from King's College London.</p>
                  <p>My career started in clinical trial management at Parexel, before moving into biotech manufacturing at Achilles Therapeutics where I was the subject matter expert for supply chain, led process development, performed statistical analysis, and built a PDF data-mining system that extracted structured data from hundreds of lab documents. At Origin Sciences, I design live interactive dashboards, build and manage EDC and LIMS systems, and have automated the ETL pipeline that combines these into real-time clinical trial reporting. I've also co-authored a publication in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
                  <h3>So why the switch to data?</h3>
                  <p>Coding was always a hobby I never took seriously — I was focused on building my career in drug development and hadn't considered it as a serious path. Then one day at Achilles, I identified a gap in how our manufacturing data was being managed and thought "I bet I could fix this with a script." <span id="hiddenText">That script turned into a full Python system that mined 500+ PDFs and returned clean, structured dataframes. The satisfaction of solving a real problem with code was genuinely transformative. Looking back, I realised I'd been doing data analysis my entire career — designing experiments, processing results, visualising trends, and presenting findings to stakeholders. The only difference was I'd been doing it all non-programmatically. Once I discovered there was a better way, I was hooked. Through a combination of self-development, side projects, and a lot of late nights, I've built the skills for a career in data analytics and beyond.</span>

                  <h3>Outside of work</h3>
                  <p>When I'm not wrangling data, you'll probably find me on a mountain (snowboarding, though "controlled falling" might be more accurate), on a badminton court, or halfway up a climbing wall questioning my life choices. I'm also a bit of a gamer — console and board games alike — I enjoy problem-solving and the thrill of a new challenge. My Shih Tzu, Momo, serves as my unofficial quality assurance manager. He doesn't understand a single line of code, but he's excellent at reminding me to take breaks and go outside.</p>
